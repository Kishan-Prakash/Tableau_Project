Tableau Project 1 : Staycatin.com Listing

As a newly joined business analyst at StayCatin.com, a platform similar to Airbnb for booking properties, I were provided with data detailing property listings, reviews, and price fluctuations. The business management asked for assistance in making informed decisions. They requested that I develop a dashboard to help answer key questions such as identifying the: 

1) Top 10 earners.
2) Examining the relationship between price and earnings.
3) Determining if any particular location (such as a shore) is generating more earnings.
4) Exploring the relationship between price and reviews.

Tableau Project 2 : IPL Dataset Case Study

After being provided with the IPL Dataset, I carefully reviewed the data to gain insights and answer the listed questions. Before proceeding with solving these questions, I followed the necessary data processing steps to ensure accuracy. Specifically, I addressed the issue of similar teams with multiple names, such as Rising Pune Supergiants, Rising Pune Supergiant, and Pune Warriors. I standardized these names to remove redundancy from the dataset.
